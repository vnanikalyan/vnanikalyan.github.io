Prosperity Consciousness Vs Poverty consciousness.  

Money is a Good Servant but a Bad Master.

**George Bernard Shaw**  
- It is the duty of every person to be rich  
- It is a sin to be poor

Natural Laws (Divine Laws)  
1) ***Everything moves***  
- Moving forward or backward  
- Grow or Die  
- Becoming richer or poorer

2) ***Sowing and Reaping***  
- Thoughts,  
- emotions,  
- feelings 
are the seeds that you sow...Harvest you reap 
Cause and Effect

Sin & Money  
- Breaking the law. Penality is Death. (you are going back)
		- you are tyring to reap without sowing
		- Getting without giving
	Money - is the reward you receive when you render a service. Higher the valuable to service higher the reward.
			- Getting money without rendering service is SIN.
	If a person receives money in an unlawful manner they will pay the price just wait.
