We are inventing new stuff so that we will have more time?

What we will do with more time? Again invent? Or Rich becoming richer.

What's the point of invention? To understand the world better and use the things that are there in the nature
- Waves
- Light etc

Anyways we are all going to die one day or the other then what is the point of invention? To become inter-planetary species?

Even on another planet, we will die for sure. What if we came for a cure for death. Living forever and storing a humongous amount of data in our brain. what is the point of living forever.

To enjoy pleasures. All pleasures will eventually lose pleasure, particularly for an individual.

Then what's the point of 
	1) Invention 
	2) Living forever 
	3) Having More time...

Do What you like? Is that the solution?
If everybody wants to do what they like then there would be chaos.
We invent to avoid chaos and bring order.

There is order all around us in Nature. Planetary motions, light speed, seasons, etc.
