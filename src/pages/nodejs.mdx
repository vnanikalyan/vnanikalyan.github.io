I learnt it from - [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFmuCDHHpwk&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)

***OOPS*** - It is a paradigm, programming style rather than a programming language.  
Programming languages that use OOPS  
- Java  
- C#  
- C++

Four pillars of OOPS  
 ***1) Encapsulation***  
Function and the data operating on it will be together  
Ex: Class

In Procedural language they(Data, functions) are decoupled  
- A good function is a function with no arguments  
- In PL you will end up with more functions and more parameters  
- To solve this problem OOPS has come up

***2) Abstraction***  
- Hiding some properties to the outside world  
- Class has properties like public, private, protected

***3) Inheritance***  
- Instead of re-inventing the wheel we can simply inherit the class where in we will get all the properties and methods from the base class
Ex: HtmlElement Class -> derived in select
	
***4) Poly-morphism***  
- render method in will behave differntly 

**OOPs in Javascript**  

1) Object literal  
		let obj = {};

2) Two ways to create Object
	 
i) **Factory Function** - Function that returns an object   		

       function createCircle(radius) {
	 			return {
	 				radius,
	 				draw: function() {
	 				console.log('draw');
	 				}
	 			};
	 		}

      const circle = createCircle(1);        

ii) **Constructor Function** - This is what we used in Grene

			function Circle(radius) {  //this means it is the reference of the object that is executing the code
	 			this.radius = radius,
	 			this.draw = function() {
	 				console.log('draw');
	 				}
	 			}
	 			//You do not write an explicit return statement
	 		}

	 		const another = new Circle(1);      

when you put new three things happen  
1) new operator will create an empty object - {}  
2) will set 'this' to point to that object (created in step 1). By default this will point to global object  
- In browser window is the global object  
- In nodeJs, global is the global object  

3) It will return the object from the function. In our case it is Circle returning an object. We wont explicitly write a return statement. Still it will return an object.


3) **Constructor Property**  
Every Object you create will have a 'constructor' property.
It has the information of which function created it.  
- Quoting the previous example  
- another.constructor - We will be able to see the function that created the object


4) Functions are Objects

5) Datatypes  
- Valuetypes - also called as PRIMITIVES
		Number, String, Boolean, Symbol, undefined, null
- Referencetypes
		Object, Array, Function

6) Getters, Setters
In Constructor function  
If you want a property value to set/get from outside

		function nani() {
		let x = 5;
		Object.defineProperty(this, x, {
			get: function() {
			return x;
			},
			set: function(value) {
				x = value;
			}
		})
		}

Array Methods  
- REDUCE- has return type  
- FILTER- has return type  
- MAP- has return type  
- FOREACH- no return type  
- EVERY- has return type

***REDUCE***  

***find the sum of the given numbers array***  
```js const numbers = [1, -1, 2, 3];

//This is what I generally do
for(const i of numbers)
	sum += i;

console.log(sum);
```

**Array.reduce**
 - We use this when we want to reduce an array to a single value
 - Single value can be a   
 	  i) Number  
 	 ii) String  
 	iii) Object
 - returns the final Value

```js
 /*Reduce will take two params
 1) Callback 
 		- accumulator: result will be stored in accumulator 
		 	- It is like Sum in my way of coding
 		- currentValue: Index Value
 2) Initial value of accumulator. In our case we initalized it to zero. 
 If you remove the initialization value then it will be initialized to the first element in the array, 
 here in our case it is 1.*/

 const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue)=>{
 	return accumulator + currentValue;
 }, 0);
```
