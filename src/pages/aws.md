  The following are the steps I took to crack the Amazon Solutions Architect - Associate Exam.

  Check out my credential [AWS solutions architect associate](https://vnkcertifications.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/AWS+Certified+Solutions+Architect+-+Associate+certificate.pdf).

**Step 1:** Took this course online [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/102CPBAEMaeV1STHkF/)

**Step 2:** Try to do hands-on what all being taught in the course  
- It will take 1-2 months (*It's subjective*)

**Step 3:**  
- Write some practise tests on **whizlabs** - *They do really help*
- Take atleast a week or two and finish all the mock tests and topic wise tests in whiz labs.

**Step 4:** Take the Exam

**Some more useful tips**  
1) You can find some free tests at [link](https://www.knowledgehut.com/practice-tests/aws-solutions-architect-associate)
